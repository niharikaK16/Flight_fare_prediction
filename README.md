# Flight Fare Prediction

This project focuses on predicting flight fares using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

Flight fare prediction is essential for both travelers and airlines to plan and optimize their trips and pricing strategies, respectively. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts flight fares based on various features such as departure time, duration, airline, and route.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical flight data including departure and arrival locations, departure time, duration, airline, and fare. The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature encoding to make it suitable for training machine learning models.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/flight-fare-prediction.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Navigate to the `Notebooks` directory and run the notebooks in sequential order to preprocess the data, explore it, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
